[Vim](Vim.md)

Vim comes standard with basic multiplexing functionality. See the below comparison to a common terminal multiplexer called tmux. Note that Vim supports only one session at a time.

| tmux     | Vim      | `:help`           |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| sessions | sessions | `:help mksession` |
| windows  | tabs     | `:help tabs`      |
| panes    | splits   | `:help split`     |
