# Existence as sacrifice

For an identity to exist (participate in being), it must sacrifice itself to its appropriate place in the identity hierarchy.[^1] This happens in two parts:

1. It must submit itself *upward* to a higher identity. (This we call *offering up*.)
2. It must give of itself *downward* to those things which partake of its own identity. (This we call *[bearing fruit](Creation is judged by its fruit.md)*.)
