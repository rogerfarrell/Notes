title: Roger Farrell's notes
---

Welcome to my personal notes. I am loosely following the
[zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) method to create a
hyperlinked network of information, similar to a wiki. This is not a
blog. It is intended firstly for my own reference. Notwithstanding, you
are more than welcome to explore to your heart's content.

As per zettelkasten methodology, these notes are not organized in a
hierarchy. Topics/categories are fluid, overlapping and interrelating as
they grow organically. Instead of folders or some other hierarchical
organization, the below registry (list of topics) serves as my entry
point. For more information see [[my-personal-zettelkasten-workflow]].

To see a frequently-updated history of stuff I am currently learning
about, check out my learning log: [[references/learning-log]].
