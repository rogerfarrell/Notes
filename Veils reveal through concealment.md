# Veils reveal through concealment

Veils are coverings which reveal through concealment. They hide the true form of that which they cover. In so doing, they reveal an imprint. This is the nature of how divine mysteries are revealed to men.[^1] [Veils can also be used deceptively.](Veils as tools for deception.md)
