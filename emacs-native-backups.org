#+TITLE: Emacs native backups

By default, Emacs will save a backup file on first write of a file
buffer. Backups should be omitted for files which are checked into
version control. They can be made by renaming or copying the source
file. This choice has implications for hard links and ownership.[fn:1]
Copying seems to be the safer option.

While many people seem to prefer sending all backups to a separate
directory, the default behavior of storing them alongside the source
files strikes me as a reasonable minimalistic approach. It makes it
easy to tell when a backup has been created. Furthermore, these
backups will be retained if the parent directory is copied/moved.
