# Background

It turns out the developer of Obsidian is a smart guy. (What a surprise!) Despite adopting different tools ([Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)), I find myself guided to a very similar style of markdown. For example, I have chosen to use `[[wikilinks]]` for internal links.

This serves two purposes:

- Internal links are visible at-a-glance in Vim and other text editors.
- The overhead of creating internal links during stream-of-consciousness is reduced.

In reading mode, Obsidian automatically postfixes [external links](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links) with a special icon. This is handy when you are jumping around in old notes with lots of hyperlinks. It is a feature worth imitating.

# Implementing the feature

For my reading mode, I host my notes at [rogerfarrell.net](https://rogerfarrell.net). They are converted to HTML via Pandoc and deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Internal link in markdown:

```markdown
[[taking-notes-in-vim]]
```

Internal link rendered to HTML via Pandoc:

```html
<a href="taking-notes-in-vim" class="wikilink">taking-notes-in-vim</a>
```

Only internal links will have the `wikilink` class. Here is how we target them with CSS:

```css
a:not(.wikilink):not([href^="https://rogerfarrell.net"]):after {
  content: "\2B08";
  font-size: 0.8em;
  line-height: 0.8em;
  vertical-align: super;
}
```

The `^=` in the href attribute denotes that the href begins with the following string. `\2B08` is the CSS representation of [â¬ˆ](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2B08).
