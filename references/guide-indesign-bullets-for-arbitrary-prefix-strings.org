#+title: Guide: InDesign bullets for arbitrary prefix strings

It is occasionally useful to set an arbitrary text prefix at the
paragraph style level. One such example is for a table of contents
where entries are formatted as follows:

: Page # -- Title of entry

InDesign's auto-generated table of contents can reproduce this entire
example with the exception of the prefixed word /Page/ followed by a
space.

We can add the prefix by creating a custom bullet character in the
/Bullets and Numbering/ section of the paragraph style options.

1. Under /Bullet Character/ choose /Add/.
2. Select the very top-left grid item. (Hovering over it will display
   a tooltip. It should be the =<control-0000>= character. This
   unicode character has no width and basically means =null=.)
3. Click /Add/
4. In the /Text After/ field, write your prefix text.
5. Choose a character style, if desired.
