* Potential causes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: potential-causes
:END:
- Defective ignition coil
- Defective spark plug
- Damaged/corroded/worn coil wiring
- Loose wiring connection or short
- Defective idle air control valve
- Carbon buildup in the throttle body

A defective ignition coil is generally considered the most common cause
of this error. However, ignition coils can fail due to bad spark plugs.
Try swapping the suspect coil to a different cylinder to rule out spark
plugs and faulty wiring.[fn:2]
