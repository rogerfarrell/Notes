*TODO* Re-watch this video and take better notes.

This talk is absolutely worth the 45 minute investment. Christopher
Webber provides a great overview of the initial relationship between
LISP and the GNU project. Originally, GNU was going to be a native LISP
machine. Unfortunately, practical concerns resulted in the adoption of
the UNIX paradigm. Emacs running on top of Linux is the somewhat
disappointing final expression of the original goals after the
compromise.
