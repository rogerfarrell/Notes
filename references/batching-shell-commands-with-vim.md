Many default shell commands lack elegant implementations for working
with multiple files. The typical workaround is to pipe *ls* to the
standard input of an intermediate command, which effectively converts
the list of filenames to a one-time shell script. While not optimal.
This workflow does enable some interesting manipulations via Vim.

# Example: renaming files

Suppose you have a group of markdown files in a directory with spaces in
the filenames.…

```zsh
\ls *.md | vim -
```

`\ls` runs the default *ls* regardless of any aliases you may have. This
ensures clean output. `vim -` opens vim with the standard input. The
result will be a new vim buffer with a list of filenames as plain text:

```zsh
a file with spaces in the name.md
another file.md
why would anyone use spaces in filenames.md
```

Now you may manipulate the filenames to create a list of shell commands.
For example, you may use block selection and substitution to create the
following.

```zsh
mv a\ file\ with\ spaces\ in\ the\ name.md              a-file-with-spaces-in-the-name.md
mv another\ file.md	                                    another-file.md
mv why\ would\ anyone\ use\ spaces\ in\ filenames.md    why-would-anyone-use-spaces-in-filenames.md
```

Finally, to run these commands line by line run the following Vim
command.

```vim
:w !sh
```
