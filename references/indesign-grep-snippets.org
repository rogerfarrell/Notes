#+title: InDesign GREP snippets

#+author: Roger Farrell
InDesign uses a Perl flavor of regex.[fn:1] The following are some
useful expressions I have accumulated over the years.

* Find page references
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: find-page-references
:END:
#+begin_example
\b(([Pp]age)|(p+\.))\s\d+
#+end_example

* Remove extra white space
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: remove-extra-white-space
:END:
This looks for contiguous white space characters and removes all but the
last instance.

Find:

#+begin_example
(\s+)(\s)
#+end_example

Replace:

#+begin_example
$2
#+end_example

[fn:1] As far as I know this is not documented by Adobe directly. See
       [[https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/120440/211504][this
       question]] on the graphic design Stack Exchange.
