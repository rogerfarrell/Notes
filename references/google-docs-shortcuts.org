#+title: Google Docs shortcuts

#+author: Roger Farrell
Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts that I use regularly (when I use
Google Docs). For the complete list, see
[[https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cmac-shortcuts][support.google.com]].

Note that the tool finder shortcut is one of two possible shortcuts for
the feature. (The other is =option= + =/=.) I have chosen the one below
for compatibility with my other apps.

| shortcut                      | description                          |
|-------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| =control= + =option= + =z=    | tool finder                          |
| =command= + =/=               | show common keyboard shortcuts       |
| =command= + =option= + [1--6] | apply heading style [1--6] at cursor |
