# The Life of Moses

by St Gregory of Nyssa

## Book II

### The Manna

In Exodus, the manna from Heaven prefigured the virgin birth, being reaped where it was not sown.

### The Divine Tabernacle

The tabernacle made without hands is [[@Christ]].

Hair is a symbol of death. It has no feeling. It is not alive.

### Everlasting Progress

Corruption is the dissolution of unity within complexity. As a simple being, God is incorruptible. His unity cannot decompose because He is not complex.

### The Bronze Serpent

The serpent is a symbol of sin.
