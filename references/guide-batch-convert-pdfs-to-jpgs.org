#+title: Guide: Batch convert PDFs to JPGs

#+author: Roger Farrell
A frequent chore I am called upon to perform is generating JPGs of book
covers from PDFs. This is especially tedious as many of the covers
belong to series. Consequently, I researched a way to perform this task
on the command line via [[https://imagemagick.org][ImageMagick]]. This
workflow allows me to process PDFs in batches via
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs][xargs]] or by writing a series of
commands in Vim which can be run line-by-line via =:w !sh=. It is much
faster than processing the images by hand.

/Note: This method pairs nicely with
[[https://github.com/xKeNcHii/Mockup-Automation-Script][this InDesign
script]] for batch generating product mockups./

First, I must convert each PDF to a high-quality JPG.[fn:1] I remove the
alpha channel and set the background to white. Otherwise, transparent
parts of the image may appear as other colors.[fn:2]

#+begin_src bash
magick -verbose \
       -density 300 \
       input.pdf \
       -background white \
       -alpha remove \
       -alpha off \
       -quality 100 \
       -flatten \
       output-f-lg.jpg
#+end_src

I also typically want a 600px wide version of every image:[fn:3]

#+begin_src bash
magick input-f-lg.jpg -resize 600 output-f-sm.jpg
#+end_src
