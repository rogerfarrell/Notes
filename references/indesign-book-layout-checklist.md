subtitle: '[[indesign]]'

There are a lot of pieces to keep track of when finalizing a book layout
in InDesign. Much of this can be generalized to a simple checklist.

- [ ] Metadata in *File Information* updated based on copyright page
- [ ] Parent pages applied correctly for all pages
- [ ] Paragraph styles for all paragraphs
- [ ] All *italics*/**bold**/etc. converted to character styles
- [ ] Auto-generated table of contents added and updated
- [ ] Bookmarks for all pages not automatically added by the Table of
  Contents (e.g. cover, back cover, copyright, table of contents, etc.)
- [ ] All internal page references converted to cross references
- [ ] All URLs converted to hyperlinks

# Optional extras

- [ ] Cover pages prepended
    - [ ] New section for cover pages
    - [ ] Section prefix: `c`
- [ ] Conditional text for multiple versions (i.e. if we need to credit
  different printers depending on the run)
