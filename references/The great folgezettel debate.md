The folgezettel debate is messy and inconclusive. It seems to be about the best way of embedding context within the structure of your zettelkasten. It is generally accepted that naming notes with the folgezettel schema imposes a single primary hierarchy for all your notes. The controversy is about whether this hierarchy is meaningful.

Those for the folgezettel schema argue that it represents the natural thought progression of the note-taker. Those against it say that this progression can be retained through manual linking.
