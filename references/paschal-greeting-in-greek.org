Χριστὸς ἀνέστη.\\
/Christ is risen!/

Ἀληθῶς ἀνέστη.\\
/Truly He is risen!/

Δόξα τῇ ἁγίᾳ αὐτοῦ τριημέρῳ ἐγέρσει.\\
/Glory to His holy Resurrection on the third day!/

Προσκυνοῦμεν αὐτοῦ τὴν τριήμερον ἔγερσιν.\\
/We worship His Resurrection on the third day!/

Χριστὸς ἀνέστη ἐκ νεκρῶν, θανάτῳ θάνατον πατήσας, καὶ τοῖς ἐν τοῖς
μνήμασι, ζωὴν χαρισάμενος.\\
/Christ is risen from the dead, by death trampling down upon death, and
to those in the tombs He has granted life./

Ἀληθῶς ἀνέστη ὁ Κύριος.\\
/Truly the Lord is risen!/
