# Why the capacitor fails

Apparently, the capacitors in household AC condensers have a limited
lifespan. They are also susceptible to failure during heatwaves. When
the condenser capacitor fails, there is insufficient electrical power to
kick-start the compressor and condenser fan. The contactor will click,
but the fan and compressor sounds will be replaced with a constant
electrical hum.

fail: <https://youtu.be/1_VtPzWxpsA?si=iEnHuE-juLnTxYyY>.*

# How to replace the capacitor

Replacing the capacitor is a fairly straightforward process. Of course,
one begins by disconnecting any electrical circuits that could be
sending power to the AC. You should also disconnect power at the
AC external contactor box. You can then remove the electrical access
panel. Next, discharge the capacitor by shorting the leads with an
insulated screw driver or other metal tool. Finally, replace the
capacitor.
