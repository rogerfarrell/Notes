title: Learning begins with exposure

It seems to be a common assumption that learning begins with the explicit formalization of a subject's first principles. Building incrementally from fundamentals, one's intellectual understanding becomes increasingly complex, culminating in so-called comprehension or mastery. This is indeed the progression of deliberate study, but learning does not begin as a deliberate exercise.

Before we approach a subject formally, there is usually a period of initial exposure in which we subconsciously accrue a significant amount of implicit context. We must become acclimated to the natural habitat of the conceptual specimens we are soon to encounter. This is a critical step. Learning in a vacuum does not work. Ideas are only meaningful in relation to other ideas and experiences. It is far easier to build the general awareness before seeking comprehension. If we attempt to do them in-parallel, we will frequently find ourselves overextending beyond the limits of our contextual exposure. In this condition we are prone false assumptions with cascading implications. The result is a kind of confusion that is not possible for someone who already has a general lay of the conceptual landscape.

By way of example, children encounter language in both spoken and written form long before they are even taught the alphabet. This is one reason why they are so quick to pick up reading and writing. For a more personal example, we need look no further than my own exploration of Vim and related tools. I encountered many YouTube videos related to Vim long before my interest was piqued. By the time I started actively learning it I was quite familiar with its modal paradigm. I do not think I could have appreciated Vim's power had I not benefited from this passive acclimation period.
