#+title: Zettelkasten rules

* Atomize thoughts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: atomize-thoughts
:END:
Each zettel should contain one single idea. Putting multiple thoughts in
a single zettel effectively creates static links. It undermines the
dynamic behavior that makes the method powerful.

* Write /everything/ in your own words
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: write-everything-in-your-own-words
:END:
Zettels are discreet personal thoughts, not citations. The goal is to
have captured the thought you had when you encountered the thing you are
citing.

* Contextualize links
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: contextualize-links
:END:
The zettelkasten method is oriented around building quality connections
between thoughts (i.e. relevance maps). Links with explicit context have
maximum utility.
