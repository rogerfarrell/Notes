title: FOSS compliments functional configuration
subtitle: '[[software]]'

The primary aim of functional configuration is reproducibility. This is
made impossible by opaque binaries which are not audit-able. FOSS[^1]
makes eliminates this scenario by guaranteeing that the source code is
always available for reference.

[^1]: *FOSS* stands for *free open source software*.
