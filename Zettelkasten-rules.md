[[zettelkasten]]

# Zettelkasten rules

## Atomize thoughts

Each zettel should contain one single idea. Putting multiple thoughts in a single zettel effectively creates static links. It undermines the dynamic behavior that makes the method powerful.

## Write *everything* in your own words

Zettels are discreet personal thoughts, not citations. The goal is to have captured the thought you had when you encountered the thing you are citing.

## Contextualize links

The zettelkasten method is oriented around building quality connections between thoughts (i.e. relevance maps). Links with explicit context have maximum utility.
