title: Find bleed info in Adobe Acrobat
---

Unfortunately, Acrobat does not show document bleed information in its document properties menu. You have to dig for it. Go to `Tools > Use Print Production > Set page boxes`. From here you can *set* various page dimensions (and therefore see current sizes). If you want to see the page size minus bleed, choose `TrimBox` from the margin controls `Apply to:` drop-down.
