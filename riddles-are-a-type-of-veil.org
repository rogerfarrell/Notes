#+title: Riddles are a type of veil

Riddles are a lot like veils. Like veils, they reveal the shape of a
thing by concealing its immediate qualities (see
[[file:veils-reveal-through-concealment.org]]). A good riddle dances all
around the subject, stringing together an intricate web of the most
diverse associations. The result is a ideological silhouette that
unequivocally identifies the hidden specimen.
