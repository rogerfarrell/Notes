title: The symbolism of reaping without sowing

Reaping where one did not sow is a prerogative of lordship. It is the claim to the product of another person's labor and property. Kings and other rulers exercise this right. Taxes and tithes are examples. As the creator out of nothing, God exercises this right on a cosmic level. The virgin birth is also an instance of this pattern.[^1]
