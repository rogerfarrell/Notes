#+title: My ZSA Voyager config

I am currently using the [[https://www.zsa.io/voyager][ZSA Voyager]] in
order to improve my shoulder and back posture. I want to maintain muscle
memory on a standard (QWERTY) Mac keyboard. Thus, I have avoided
alternative layouts. However, I have elected to implement home row mods.
I feel this is a worthwhile deviation, as the modifier layouts on
traditional layouts leave much wanting for complex shortcuts.
