#+title: A critique of critical thinking

While critical thinking has a neutral definition,[fn:1] the term carries
a lot of baggage and vague associations. It seems to be conflated with
the capacity to rebut critical attacks on dearly-held convictions. In
this sense, it is compared against deconstructive analysis. It must be
employed to constructively repair the damage done by malicious
deconstructive (i.e. worthless) attackers.

Of course, deconstruction is also a subset of (correctly understood)
critical thinking. Analytical skills can be used both to construct and
deconstruct ideas. We do students a disservice by stigmatizing the
deconstructive potential of analytical reasoning.
