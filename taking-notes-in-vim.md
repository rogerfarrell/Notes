Vim is a great platform for taking notes. However, some constraints are necessary to maximize efficiency for real-time thought-capture.


# Constraints

## Use Markdown syntax

Markdown is the de facto standard for note-taking.

### Use the Pandoc Markdown spec

Markdown lacks a single definitive spec. Since Pandoc is the best tool for Markdown conversion, I will be following the [Pandoc Markdown spec](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). If a fallback is required for further clarity, I will use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm).

### Use wikilinks for internal reference

Wikilinks are simple and fast to create and use. Also, they do not require display text.


## Avoid plugins

See this great article to get started writing notes in vanilla Vim: <https://joereynolds.github.io/vim/2018/07/07/you-dont-need-vimwiki.html>. This one is not bad either: <https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/42-vim_notetaking/#step-4-methods-for-finding-notes>.
