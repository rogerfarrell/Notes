#+title: How Christians die for the sin of the world

Christ heals humanity by sharing our death. In so doing, He undoes the
power of death. As members of His body,
[[file:christians-should-advance-the-kingdom-of-heaven.org][Christians are
to help advance the Kingdom of heaven.]] We accomplish this by sharing
in His suffering, taking up our own
crosses.[fn:1][fn:2][fn:3][fn:4][fn:5]

The suffering and death of the saints perpetuates the breaking of
death's power. Telemachus exemplified this principle in his martyrdom.
His death catalyzed an entire civilization's deliverance from the
bloodlust of the gladiatorial games.[fn:6]

[fn:1] *Luke 9:23--27, Matthew 16:24--28:* Christ calls us to take up
       our cross and follow him.

[fn:2] *Matthew 5:10--11:* the beatitudes about those who are persecuted

[fn:3] *Matthew 5:38--42:* turning the other cheek

[fn:4] *Acts 5:40--42:* the Apostles rejoiced in suffering for the name.

[fn:5] *Colossians 1:24--26:* Paul is filling up what is lacking in
       Christ's afflictions
