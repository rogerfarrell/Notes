#+title: Internalized vs externalized config

Configuration files are a form of active externalism. By configuring
software, I am able to reduce the overhead of setting up an environment
every time I do a repetitive task. I am externalizing the setup, along
with my implementation philosophy for a given tool. This is a
tremendously powerful pattern, but there is a trade-off:

* Pros
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pros
:END:
- Potential efficiency gains
- Less /behavioral boilerplate/[fn:1] in the process after setup

* Cons
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cons
:END:
- I lose muscle memory and familiarity from manually setting things how
  I want every time.
- Incremental deviation from native best-practices or intended use of
  tools
- Lost opportunities for learning

[fn:1] */TODO/* Explore the concept of /behavioral boilerplate/ and
       potentially write a note about it
