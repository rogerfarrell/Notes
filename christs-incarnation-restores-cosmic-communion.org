#+title: Christ's incarnation restores cosmic communion

Man was created to be the axis of creation, the mediator of divine life

creation was left without a mediator. Through the incarnation, Christ
becomes theÂ New Adam, mankind's own mediator. Thereby, he restores man
to his original purpose and

offspring]].
