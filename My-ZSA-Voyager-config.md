# My ZSA Voyager config

I am currently using the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) in order to improve my shoulder and back posture. I want to maintain muscle memory on a standard (QWERTY) Mac keyboard. Thus, I have avoided alternative layouts. However, I have elected to implement home row mods. I feel this is a worthwhile deviation, as the modifier layouts on traditional layouts leave much wanting for complex shortcuts.

<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">

</div>
