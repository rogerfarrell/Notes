#+title: FOSS compliments functional configuration

The primary aim of functional configuration is reproducibility. This is
made impossible by opaque binaries which are not audit-able. FOSS[fn:1]
makes eliminates this scenario by guaranteeing that the source code is
always available for reference.

[fn:1] /FOSS/ stands for /free open source software/.
