title: Piety strives not for perfection
subtitle: '[[religion]]'
---

True piety is found in brutally honest humility. To live the Christian
life well, one must accept the extent of one's own depravity. Man wholly
lacks the capacity for unadulterated good. Perfection is simply
unattainable, and striving for it is an expression of pride. Piety is
realized in the continual reapplication of one's total energy in a
progression of increasing purity.
