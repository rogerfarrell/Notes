Incremental learning depends on practice. There is a numinous dimension
to every subject. This experiential facet cannot be absorbed without
hands-on experience. What is more: intellectual understanding gives way
to a much more complete numinous relationship with a subject once one
has been experientially immersed in it for a sufficient period. This
understanding is the fruition of the initial exposure which was also
numinous. [[file:learning-begins-with-exposure.org]] Learning seems to begin
and end with exposure. It begins with building basic awareness. It ends
with comprehensive awareness.
