A zip format that contains both the source files and the exported
result. It behaves as if it is only the export, so it can be used as a
linked asset by any application. Supposing the source is a PSD. The
export can be a JPEG. Now, changes made to the PSD will re-export the
JPEG. However, apps that cannot read PSDs do not see the source file.
