I firmly believe that technology, specifically computers, have superb
potential for net gains in human productivity *and* well-being.
Unfortunately, tools can create dependencies by diminishing our manual
practice of a given task.

# High level goals

- self-documenting
- facilitating learning
- purpose-built

I want a system that:

- leverages code as the UI
- minimizes abstractions
- minimizes distractions
