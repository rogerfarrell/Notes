The zettelkasten method aims to structure information via connections.
Connections are the ideas you have. They are the moments where things
fall into place. To use the method correctly, one must carefully avoid
collecting information needlessly. It must be fertile with connections.
The three types of notes (fleeting, reference, and zettel) each have
their place in this process. There must be ground for ideas to grow.
This is when reference notes are appropriate. They help to store
information that still has many connections to be discovered. References
should only be recorded for current areas of study and related subjects
which are sure to yield connections. Fleeting notes help to capture
connections as they begin to form. Zettels are where the connections are
permanently documented.

Note that zettels will often map only vaguely back to the references.
Because of their atomized nature, they will naturally interlock with
other zettels, but the reference notes will be subject specific. This is
why many choose to put references at the end of their notes. They may be
better thought of as further reading.

- Notes are only for original ideas
- References are for everything else.
- Notes can link to references, not vice versa.
