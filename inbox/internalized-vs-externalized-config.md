title: Internalized vs externalized config
---

Configuration files are a form of active externalism. There is a trade-off:

## Pros

- Potential efficiency gains
- Less *boilerplate* in the process as it is acted out

## Cons

- I lose practiced memory from manually setting things how I want every time.
- Incremental deviation from native best-practices or intended use of tools
- Lost opportunities for learning.
