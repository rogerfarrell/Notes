My goal is to learn Vim according to its design and use principles. I
want to leverage its built in interface (including `:help`). When that
fails, I want to fall back on its code (vimscript). When that fails, I
want to leverage the command line. My goal is to first use Vim in the
most efficient way possible (the Vim way) and to build automations on
top of that. I do not want to create an automation for something that
can be done simply and easily with manual Vim. Doing so will retard the
pace of my assimilation of Vim principles.
