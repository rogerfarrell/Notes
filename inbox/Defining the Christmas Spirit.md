- Christ's advent can be viewed chronologically and kairotically
  - Chronologically, advent is a historical past reality.
  - Kairotically, advent is a present, annual occurence.
- In the present, we participate in both these dimensions of Christmas.
- Chronologically
  - Reading the Christmas story
  - Christmas pageants
  - Nativity sets
- Kairotically
  - The Chronological Christmas narrative is a direct analog to present Christmas traditions
  - Christ brings "peace on earth, goodwill toward men"
  - This phrase is the central idea behind the charactaristic generosity and charity of the Christmas season
  - The *Christmas Spirit* is the natural human response to the noumenous experience of kairotic participation in Christ's advent.
