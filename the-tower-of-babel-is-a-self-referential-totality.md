Man was instructed to name the animals. God Himself named man. The
builders' effort to self-name was an explicit attempt to be like God by
displacing Him as the ordering principle of the cosmos.[^1] As the means of
their unsanctioned ascent, the tower was an artificial totality whose
top was man. The top reached into the heavens. It was intended to
elevate man beyond the mortal plain into the divine realm. Of course,
this was a fated endeavor. Mortal artifices crumble in the presence of
true divinity: [[the-tower-of-babel-is-a-self-referential-totality]].

[^1]: This is the same pattern as the Numenorean war on Valinor.
