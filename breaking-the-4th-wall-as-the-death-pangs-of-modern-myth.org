#+title: Breaking the 4th wall as the death pangs of modern myth

Modern storytelling is obsessed with 4th wall breaking and parallel
universes. This seems to be a symptom of the disconnect between modern
stories and transcendent myth. Myth is the lifeblood of narrative. In
its absence, stories are not anchored to patterns of cosmic symbolic
coherence. They become self-referential totalities like the Tower of
Babel: [[file:the-tower-of-babel-is-a-self-referential-totality.org]]. As
the death knell tolls, contemporary stories are seeking a way to escape
their dying universes.[fn:1] 4th wall breaking and parallel universes
are like the distant shore of the undying lands, seducing mortals with
the promise of immortality.

[fn:1] This fine artist's frame-breaking style is a palpable expression
       of this sentiment:
