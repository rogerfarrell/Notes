#+title: The symbolism of reaping without sowing

Reaping where one did not sow is a prerogative of lordship. It is the
claim to the product of another person's labor and property. Kings and
other rulers exercise this right. Taxes and tithes are examples. As the
creator out of nothing, God exercises this right on a cosmic level. The
virgin birth is also an instance of this pattern.[fn:1]
