title: Christ's incarnation restores cosmic communion
---

Man was created to be the axis of creation, the mediator of divine life [[existence-as-sacrifice|through sacrifice]]. Upon man’s fall, the creation was left without a mediator. Through the incarnation, Christ becomes the New Adam, mankind’s own mediator. Thereby, he restores man to his original purpose and [[the-strife-of-adams-offspring|restores the unity of Adam's offspring]].
