## Potential causes

- Defective ignition coil
- Defective spark plug
- Damaged/corroded/worn coil wiring 
- Loose wiring connection or short
- Defective idle air control valve 
- Carbon buildup in the throttle body

A defective ignition coil is generally considered the most common cause of this error. However, ignition coils can fail due to bad spark plugs. Try swapping the suspect coil to a different cylinder to rule out spark plugs and faulty wiring. Check out [these instructions](How to replace spark plugs on a Toyota 2GR-FE.md) on how to spark plugs (and consequently ignition coils).
