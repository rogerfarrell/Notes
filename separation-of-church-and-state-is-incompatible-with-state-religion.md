title: Separation of Church and state is incompatible with state religion
subtitle: '[[religion]]'

Yes, the title is tautological. However, there is some important insight
in the defense of this obvious claim. Separation of Church and state is
typically thought of as a check on religious tyranny via division of
power. Proponents of the concept are often very strong advocates of
state religious affiliations.

This presents a contradiction when carefully evaluated. All mainline
religions make claims of primacy and exclusivity. A state which
authentically espouses such a religion reserves no right to qualify its
adherence to its chosen religious tenets. In so doing, it fully submits
to the religious authority.

Conversely, a state which maintains separation of civic and religious
authority must be coequal in primacy to any religion it considers. Since
religions make exclusive claims to primacy, they are not compatible with
such a state. The only possible outcome is the secularization of the
political space.

The key takeaway is that anything less that total submission to a
religious authority is a secular state of being.
