A thriving church will have considerable social influence. This will extend to the point that the non-christian community will begin to take cues from (and eventually emulate) the church. Over the span of multiple generations, the result will be the outward christianization of the culture. 

This is good for two reasons:

1. It is an indication of a strong, influential church.
2. It is the optimal condition for non-believers. With God's grace, they may come to see and appreciate the truth they actively participate in.
