title: Cultural Christianity is a good thing
subtitle: '[[religion]]'

A thriving church will have considerable social influence. This will
extend to the point that the non-christian community will begin to take
cues from (and eventually emulate) the church. Over the span of multiple
generations, the result will be the outward christianization of the
culture.[^1]

[^1]: This *outward christianization* is a ready target for ridicule.
    Yet, this honest picture of Christian culture rather mirrors the
    humble state of the individual Christian life:
    [[piety-strives-not-for-perfection]].

This is good for two reasons:

1. It is an indication of a strong, influential church.
2. It is the optimal condition for non-believers. With God's grace, they
   may come to see and appreciate the truth they actively participate
   in.
