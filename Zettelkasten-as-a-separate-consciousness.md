title: Zettelkasten as a separate consciousness
subtitle: '[[zettelkasten]]'
---

It is better to think of a zettelkasten as a separate consciousness, not an extension of one's brain. According to this principle, it is important to consider whether the information at-hand belongs in your own mind.

- If it is required for everyday functioning, entirely phenomenological, or otherwise critical to retain in your memory, it does not belong in the zettelkasten.
- Conversely, information that is processed as an inner dialog is perfectly suited for the zettelkasten.  (E.g. Documentation, musings, research)
