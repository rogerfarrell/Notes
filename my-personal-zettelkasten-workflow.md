- On mobile, all note-taking goes into the inbox. Later, they are sanitized and organized in Vim.

The zettelkasten method yields a web of hyperlinked notes. A strategy for creating entrypoints into this web is essential to efficient navigation as memory fades. Many people employ the [folgezettel](references/the-great-folgezettel-debate.md) schema for this purpose. However, I have chosen to do this via structure (or hub) notes.

Hub notes are constituted of hierarchical lists of other notes mapped by a given topic. I will be using tags to implement this feature as can be found in my [zettelkasten workflow](taking-notes-in-vim.md). At the time of creation, every note will be linked to at least one structure note.
