[[zettelkasten]]

# My personal zettelkasten workflow

## Realtime idea capture

- On mobile, all note-taking goes into the inbox. Later, they are sanitized and organized in Vim.
- I keep a learning log to track concepts I have explored: [[references/ecclesiastical-history]].

# Navigating my notes

The zettelkasten method yields a web of hyperlinked notes. A strategy for creating entrypoints into this web is essential to efficient navigation as memory fades. Many people employ the [[references/the-great-folgezettel-debate|folgezettel]] schema for this purpose. However, I have chosen to do this via structure (or hub) notes.

Hub notes are constituted of hierarchical lists of other notes mapped by a given topic. I will be using tags to implement this feature as can be found in my [[taking-notes-in-vim|note-taking workflow]]. At the time of creation, every note will be linked to at least one structure note.
