title: Reference notes are important for Vim help docs
subtitle: '[[vim]], [[zettelkasten]]'
---

Initially, I made the mistake of referencing the Vim's help docs
directly. I assumed this would be effective since it is extremely stable
and easy to reference. It turns out, this fails to capture an important
interpretive layer. The help docs are clear, but they are so tightly
self-referencing that it can be difficult to get the complete picture of
any one feature or topic. Creating reference notes for help topics
mitigates this problem by allowing every topic to be self-sufficient.
The help itself is still the source of truth and primary reference, but
the amount of time required to productively review it is reduced.
