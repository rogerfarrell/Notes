Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts that I use regularly (when I use Google Docs). For the complete list, see [support.google.com](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cmac-shortcuts).

Note that the tool finder shortcut is one of two possible shortcuts for the feature. (The other is `option` + `/`.) I have chosen the one below for compatibility with my other apps.

| shortcut                     | description                         |
| :--                          | :--                                 |
| `control` + `option` + `z`   | tool finder                         |
| `command` + `/`              | show common keyboard shortcuts      |
| `command` + `option` + [1–6] | apply heading style [1–6] at cursor |
