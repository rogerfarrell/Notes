`vim`

Vim is a great platform for taking notes. However, some constraints are necessary to maximize efficiency for real-time thought-capture.

# Markdown syntax

Markdown is the de facto standard for note-taking, it lacks a single definitive spec. Since Pandoc is the best tool for Markdown conversion, I will be following the [Pandoc Markdown spec](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). If a fallback is required for further clarity, I will use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm).

# Tags

I will be using two separate tag formats.

- I will use the `` `tag` `` format to list topics contained within a regular note.
- Over time, I will want to create hub notes for every tag (the tag definitions, if you will). Each of these hubs will be be tagged with `:name-of-topic:`, enumerating the tag for which it is a hub.
