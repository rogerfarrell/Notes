#+title: Flag external links with css

It turns out the developer of Obsidian is a smart guy. (What a
surprise!) Despite adopting different tools,[fn:1] I find myself guided
to a very similar style of markdown. For example, I have chosen to use
=[[wikilinks]]= for internal links. This serves two purposes:

- Internal links are visible at-a-glance in Vim and other text editors.
- The overhead of creating internal links during stream-of-consciousness
  is reduced.

Once again taking inspiration from Obsidian, I have decided to flag
external links with a special character. This is handy when you are
jumping around in old notes with lots of hyperlinks. It is a feature
worth imitating.

For my reading mode, I host my notes at [[https://rogerfarrell.net]].
They are converted to HTML via Pandoc and deployed with
[[https://pages.github.com][GitHub Pages]].

Internal link in markdown:

#+begin_src markdown
[[taking-notes-in-vim]]
#+end_src

Internal link rendered to HTML via Pandoc:

#+begin_src html
<a href="taking-notes-in-vim" class="wikilink">taking-notes-in-vim</a>
#+end_src

Here is how we target them with CSS:

#+begin_src css
a[href^="http"]:not([href^="https://rogerfarrell.net"]):after
{
  content:"\2B08"; /* this is a Northeast-pointed arrow to signify external links */
  font-size: 0.8em;
  line-height: 0.8em;
  vertical-align: super;
}
#+end_src

The =^== in the href attribute denotes that the href /begins/ with the
specified string. =\2B08= is the CSS representation of â¬ˆ.
