Christ heals humanity by sharing our death. In so doing, He undoes the power of death. As members of His body, [[christians-should-advance-the-kingdom-of-heaven|Christians are to help advance the Kingdom of heaven.]] We accomplish this by sharing in His suffering, taking up our own crosses.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

The suffering and death of the saints perpetuates the breaking of death's power. Telemachus exemplified this principle in his martyrdom. His death catalyzed an entire civilization's deliverance from the bloodlust of the gladiatorial games.[^6]
