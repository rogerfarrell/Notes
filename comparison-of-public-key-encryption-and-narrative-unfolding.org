#+title: Comparison of public key encryption and narrative unfolding

Public key encryption works by using a public encryption key and a
private decryption key. Anyone can encrypt a message with the public
key, but only the private key holder can decrypt these messages. This
works thanks to some fancy math which effectively makes
reverse-engineering the private key infeasible.

Storytelling seems to work in much the same way. Early on in a
narrative, the audience is presented with the majority of relevant
details which compose the core narrative. A keen mind can often discern
these features. Yet, the core narrative remains obscured by the sheer
number of configurations into which these details can be assembled. The
story has been publicly encrypted. Only with the help of the author can
the final, correct configuration be discovered.
