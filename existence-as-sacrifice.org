#+title: Existence as sacrifice

For an identity to exist (participate in being), it must sacrifice
itself to its appropriate place in the identity hierarchy.[fn:1] This
happens in two parts:

1. It must submit itself /upward/ to a higher identity. (This we call
   /offering up/.)
2. It must give of itself /downward/ to those things which partake of
   its own identity. (This we call
   /[[file:creation-is-judged-by-its-fruit.org][bearing fruit]]/.)
