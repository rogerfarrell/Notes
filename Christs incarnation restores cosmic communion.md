# Christ's incarnation restores cosmic communion

Man was created to be the axis of creation, the mediator of divine life [through sacrifice](Existence as sacrifice.md). Upon man’s fall, the creation was left without a mediator. Through the incarnation, Christ becomes the New Adam, mankind’s own mediator. Thereby, he restores man to his original purpose and [restores the unity of Adam's offspring](The strife of Adams offspring.md).
